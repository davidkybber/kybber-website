This is simply my ramblings on things I learned from doing a Sabbatical abroad, in the context on how to improve it for next time. No miyagi wisdom, just simply from a planning perspective and what I value when having time off!

# Planning Fatigue

One of the main issues I faced during my sabbatical was planning fatigue. It crept up slowly and was not noticeable during my first trip. However, by the second and third trips, it became overwhelming. The fatigue stemmed partly from organizing trips with multiple people, especially in larger groups, and partly from trying to fill days with activities when traveling alone. Both scenarios were draining and detracted significantly from my experience. I often found myself stressing about the next trip—booking flights, coordinating with friends, and managing rising prices.

To cope with this, I discovered that setting specific days aside solely for planning was incredibly helpful. By designating certain times for this task and agreeing not to think about it outside these slots, I was able to reduce stress while ensuring I had enough time to plan properly.

# No goal

The free-spirited backpacking trips of my youth no longer provided the same thrill. Many activities that once excited me in my twenties now felt mundane. The worst parts of my trips were when I traveled without any specific agenda, just exploring aimlessly. While this can be enjoyable to an extent, it quickly became tedious and boring in the long term.

To counter this, I started setting more specific goals for each trip, often centered around sports. Climbing a particular mountain, skiing at a renowned location, or running a famous trail gave my travels a sense of purpose and excitement that mere exploration no longer offered.

# Freedom to explore without it being pointless

One of the joys of travel is the freedom to explore, but without a clear purpose, this can sometimes feel aimless and unfulfilling. To strike a balance, I began incorporating flexible itineraries that allowed for spontaneous exploration while still having a central goal. This way, I could enjoy the thrill of discovering new places without the experience feeling pointless. For instance, if my main objective was to hike a specific trail, I would leave time before and after for unplanned adventures in the surrounding areas.

# Balance between being alone and being with friends

Finding the right balance between traveling alone and with friends was another challenge. Solo travel offers unmatched freedom and the opportunity for self-discovery, but too much of it can lead to loneliness. Conversely, traveling with friends can be incredibly rewarding but sometimes overwhelming.

To address this, I started planning trips that included both solo and group elements. For instance, I might begin a journey on my own to explore at my own pace and then meet up with friends later for shared activities. This approach allowed me to enjoy the best of both worlds—personal freedom and social connection.

# Close to home is underrated

In my quest for adventure, I often overlooked destinations close to home. However, I discovered that some of the most relaxing places were those that were somewhat new yet not overwhelming. These nearby spots offered a sense of novelty without the stress of completely unfamiliar territory.

Traveling close to home also significantly reduced the stress of planning since I already had some familiarity with the area. This allowed me to focus on the main things that mattered—enjoying the experience, connecting with the environment, and making meaningful memories—without being bogged down by extensive logistics or uncertainties. By incorporating local travel into my plans, I found a renewed appreciation for my own region and experienced unique adventures with less hassle.
